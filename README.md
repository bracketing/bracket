**Bracket** is an Elegant static site generator. It encapsulates **[Jinja2](https://github.com/pallets/jinja)**. Its biggest highlight is to render the static pages in the form of **view function**, and support real-time **debugging**. It can also support **CSS framework**, **international routing** and more functions through ecological extension.
